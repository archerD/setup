The statusbar of choice is xmobar.
xmobar can be installed using cabal.
Cabal can be installed via apt and the cabal-install repository
Once it is installed, run cabal update to get the list of packages,
and then cabal install xmobar --flags="all_extensions"
may have to add --installdir=$HOME/.cabal/bin/ to previous command.

Once xmobar is installed, the configuration is in dotfiles, link to $HOME.
The xmonad.hs config file in dotfiles already automatically launches xmonad, so that should be good to go.

Things needed by xmobar:
One thing is that the padding-icon.sh needs to be made available.
This file is in the xmobar repository, at https://github.com/jaor/xmobar.

Another thing is gsimplecal, availible from repo gsimplecal via apt.
