Assuming vim has been installed.
Can be installed using apt, preferably the vim-gtk3 package

Download vim configuration:
    git clone https://github.com/archerD/.vim.git
    use .vim/base.vim until plugins are setup.
    This can be done by either adding source .vim/base.vim to a vimrc,
    or symlinking the vimrc file to .vim/base.vim

Configure editor/terminal??

Installing plugins:
    First, install vundle:
        git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    Then source .vim/plugins.vim, either in vim, or in the vimrc
    then run :PluginInstall in vim, which should go through and install all the listed plugins.
    Once this is done, source-all.vim can be used instead of base.vim either as the target of the vimrc symlink or the file sourced in the vimrc

YouCompleteMe setup:
    YouCompleteMe has a compiled component which vundle does not compile.
    First, the dependencies need to be installed:
        build-essential cmake for the build tools, 
        python3-dev mono-complete golang nodejs default-jdk npm for the frameworks.
    Then cd to .vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe, and run python3 install.py --all

    This finishes the default setup.
    
Adding Haskell support for YouCompleteMe:
    TODO
