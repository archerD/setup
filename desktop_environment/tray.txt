The tray I use is trayer, installable via apt from repo trayer.
The .xsessionrc file in xconfigfiles already starts up trayer upon login

The .xsessionrc file is also configured to launch the following applets:
xfce4-power-manager, nm-applet, blueman-applet, pasystray, kdeconnect-indicator, yubioath-desktop, and redshift-gtk.

xfce4-power-manager, blueman-applet, pasystray, and redshift-gtk are installable via apt, using repos xfce4-power-manager, blueman, pasystray, and redshift-gtk, respectively.

nm-applet is preinstalled, instructions for yubioath-desktop are in yubico.txt.
