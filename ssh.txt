First thing first, create an ssh key and add it to places.
Following https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_configuring-key-based-authentication

    create the key using ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
        the default save location is fine for this.

places worth adding: other computers I own, knuth, github.
    add to computer/server using ssh-copy-id -i "path/to/key" "user@host"
    path to key usually defaults to "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
    will have to log into the server using password...

Next create a ssh config file, in ~/.ssh/config
Example contents:
    Host knuth
        HostName knuth.cs.hmc.edu
        User deflores
        ForwardAgent yes
        ForwardX11Trusted yes

    # desktop
    Host desktop
        HostName 192.168.1.216
        User archerd
        ForwardAgent yes
        ForwardX11Trusted yes

    Host *


To set up as server:
install the openssh-server package from apt.
might automatically open the correct ports for ufw, but if not, this should do it: sudo ufw allow ssh/tcp

at this point knowing the ip address will be extremely useful, can found by running ifconfig (may need to install net-tools via apt to get package).

copy any ssh keys as above

Then it would probably be good to remove password logins... and maybe root logins...
edit the config file in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, changing the settings to below
    PermitRootLogin No
    PasswordAuthentication no
then restart the ssh server: systemctl restart ssh
