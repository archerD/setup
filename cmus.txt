Need to build from source to get mpris support.
Download source from https://github.com/cmus/cmus

build dependencies (installable via apt): 
bash-completion libao-dev libasound2-dev libavcodec-dev \
            libavformat-dev libswresample-dev libcddb2-dev libcdio-cdda-dev \
            libcue-dev libdiscid-dev libfaad-dev libflac-dev libjack-dev \
            libmad0-dev libmodplug-dev libmpcdec-dev libncursesw5-dev \

            libsndio-dev libvorbis-dev libwavpack-dev libsystemd-dev pkg-config

build instructions:
./configure # --help to see options, otherwise generates the config.mk file with the features configured
make
make install # needs root access

Configuration stuff:
A theme exists in dotfiles... but the night theme is pretty good.

Detachable cmus via tmux (from https://github.com/cmus/cmus/wiki/detachable-cmus): ! Not currently using this !
This does require tmux installed.
add alias to ~/.profile or .bashrc or whatever file holds your aliases (in bash_aliases from dotfiles):
    alias cmus='tmux attach-session -t cmus || tmux new-session -A -D -s cmus "$(which cmus)"'
run command in cmus:
    :bind -f common q shell tmux detach-client

Currently the shell aliases have an alias for cmus to be launched using abduco.
