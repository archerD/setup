This file describes the application launchers I use.
These include gnome-pie, yeganesh, and dmenu.

gnome-pie and dmenu are installable via apt from repositories gnome-pie and suckless-tools.
yeganesh is a wrapper for dmenu that is installable from cabal: cabal install yeganesh.
Then, yeganesh needs to be added to the path, either by adding ~/.cabal/bin to the path or linking yeganesh in ~/bin (prefered).
The advantage of yeganesh is that it shows frequently used things first, as opposed to dmenu, which shows the best match first, and doesn't remember previous selections.

The config files for gnome-pie is in the dotfiles repo.
Yeganesh will generate it's own frequency map over time.
gnome-pie is linked into xmobar for some of the menus, and yeganesh and dmenu are bound to keys in xmonad.

TODO: Another thing to explore: Rofi (installable via apt)
