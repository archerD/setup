Currently need to build from source to get enough features from playerctld
source is at https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl

need to install meson and ninja build tools, installable via apt (meson ninja-build)

build dependencies include gobject-introspection libglib2.0-dev libgirepository1.0-dev gtk-doc-tools

build commands are 
    meson mesonbuild
    sudo ninja -C mesonbuild install

Ensure there is no leftover stuff from an apt install of playerctl
