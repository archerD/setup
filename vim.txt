Assuming vim has been installed.
Can be installed using apt, preferably the vim-gtk3 package

Download vim configuration:
    git clone https://github.com/archerD/.vim.git
Alternative download:
    clone the dotfiles repository: git clone git@github.com:archerD/dotfiles
    and run the install script: cd dotfiles && ./install
After download:
    use .vim/base.vim until plugins are setup.
    This can be done by either adding source .vim/base.vim to a vimrc,
    or symlinking the vimrc file to .vim/base.vim
    The vimrc file can usually be either ~/.vimrc or ~/.vim/vimrc.

Configure editor/terminal??
	(set -o vi)

Installing plugins:
    First, install vundle:
        git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
    Then source .vim/plugins.vim, either in vim, or in the vimrc
    then run :PluginInstall in vim, which should go through and install all the listed plugins.
    Once this is done, source-all.vim can be used instead of base.vim either as the target of the vimrc symlink or the file sourced in the vimrc

YouCompleteMe setup:
    YouCompleteMe has a compiled component which vundle does not compile.
    First, the dependencies need to be installed (via apt):
        build-essential cmake for the build tools, 
        python3-dev mono-complete golang nodejs default-jdk npm for the frameworks.
    Then cd to .vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe, and run python3 install.py --all

    This finishes the default setup.
    
Adding Haskell support for YouCompleteMe:
    To do this we need to install and setup haskell-language-server (https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
    Since I don't currently use ghcup for haskell stuff, we will install from source.
    Make sure cabal is installed (installable via apt from cabal-install)
    Then install other dependencies: sudo apt install libicu-dev libncurses-dev libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev
    Then get the source code: git clone https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server --recurse-submodules
    Then in the repo, use ./cabal-hls-install script.
    Pass the help command to see options.  The option to probably use is hls: ./cabal-hls-install hls
    May take some time to get all the packages it needs the first time it is run.
    If cabal is out of date, update cabal using: cabal install Cabal cabal-install
    Once the build finishes, link to the executables from somewhere in the path.

    This provides the LSP for haskell, but YCM still needs to be setup to use it.
    This setup is in .vim/plugin-settings.vim.
