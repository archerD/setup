This file describes the application launchers I use.
These include gnome-pie, rofi, yeganesh, and dmenu.

gnome-pie and dmenu are installable via apt from repositories gnome-pie and suckless-tools.
yeganesh is a wrapper for dmenu that is installable from cabal: cabal install yeganesh.
Then, yeganesh needs to be added to the path, either by adding ~/.cabal/bin to the path or linking yeganesh in ~/bin (prefered).
The advantage of yeganesh is that it shows frequently used things first, as opposed to dmenu, which shows the best match first, and doesn't remember previous selections.

The config files for gnome-pie is in the dotfiles repo.
Yeganesh will generate it's own frequency map over time.
gnome-pie is linked into xmobar for some of the menus, and yeganesh and dmenu are bound to keys in xmonad.

TODO: Another thing to explore: Rofi
    Rofi also has a frequency map, and easy to explore builtin themes
    Look into how to install more recent versions of rofi and the extra plugins/extensions/modi.
    To install from source:
    clone from git: https://github.com/davatorium/rofi.git
    dependencies to install (that were not already installed):
        libxcb-util-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxcb-ewmh-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-cursor-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev libstartup-notification0-dev 
        gitlab-shell flex bison
    from project root directory:
        meson setup build
        ninja -C build
        sudo ninja -C build install
    Config in dotfiles.
