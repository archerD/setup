First thing first, create an ssh key and add it to places.
Following https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/troubleshooting#_configuring-key-based-authentication

    create the key using ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
        the default save location is fine for this.

places worth adding: other computers I own, knuth, github.
    add to computer/server using ssh-copy-id -i "path/to/key" "user@host"
    path to key usually defaults to "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
