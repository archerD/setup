build instructions:
./configure # --help to see options, otherwise generates the config.mk file with the features configured
make
make install # needs root access

Configuration stuff:
A theme exists in dotfiles... but the night theme is pretty good.

Detachable cmus via screen:
add alias to ~/.profile or .bashrc or whatever file holds your aliases:
    alias cmus='screen -q -r -D cmus || screen -S cmus $(which cmus)'
run command in cmus:
    :bind -f common q shell screen -d cmus
