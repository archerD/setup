To synchronize data between computers, use unison.
Source is at https://github.com/bcpierce00/unison, however, prebuilt releases from the releases tab should be sufficient.
Download an appropriate release file, extract it and add an alias for the gtk version.

Run unison, and it will eventually pop open a gui.
Then create a profile.  the host can be an ssh host. add a path variable to only synchronize some parts of the roots.

Directories worth syncing:
