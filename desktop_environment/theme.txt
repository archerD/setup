Themes are weird.
Part of the theme is the wallpaper handled by feh.
The tray and statusbar have their own theming, as does xmonad.
To theme gtk applications (such as chrome [does this even work?], evince, etc.) use lxappearance (installable via apt).
Current gtk themes are Yaru-dark for applications with yaru icon set.

At some point I'll figure out a theme, but today is not that day.
