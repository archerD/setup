The programs arandr and autorandr are useful for managing the physical displays.
Both are installable via apt.
arandr displays a gui for configuring the monitorse
autorandr automates the detection and application of monitor configurations.
    once a configuration is setup, it can be saved with autorandr --save name
    profiles can be loaded by autorandr --load name, or autochanged by autorandr -c
    configs are saved in ~/.config/autorandr/
    post and pre hooks can be added to this directory as well
    for example, the file ~/.config/autorandr/postswitch could have the contents
        #!/bin/sh
        feh --bg-scale /home/archerd/bitma2p.png
    and this script would be run after everytime autorandr changes the displays.
    individual configs can also have hooks, by adding a similar file inside the particular configurations directory.

    autorandr -c is called by the .xsessionrc in xconfigfiles

Other programs for the displays are
    feh, for setting the background image, and
    xscreensaver, for a screensaver and screening locking.
both are installable via apt.
both are called by the .xsessionrc in xconfigfiles

installing just xscreensaver gives a working xscreensaver, however, additional screensavers can be downloaded by installing the following repos from apt: xscreensaver-gl xscreensaver-data-extra
xscreensaver can be configured by running xscreensaver-demo
