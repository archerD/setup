# Setup
This repository contains setup instructions for my machines.
They assume the installed system is Ubuntu 20.04, the current LTS at the time of writing.
The os can be downloaded from https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop, and a bootable drive created using usb-creator-gtk on ubuntu, or [rufus](rufus.ie) on windows.
Installation is then done by booting from the drive, and following instructions.

## Where to go
Once the os is installed, start with first_steps.txt

From there, good places to go are

* ssh.txt
* firewall.txt
* vim.txt
* desktop_environment/
* shell.txt
* logid.txt

Also, reference misc_programs.txt for various programs to install.

The guide will reference several other repositories:
* archerD/dotfiles, or xconfigfiles, contains a variety of configuration files I use
* archerD/.vim, contains my vim config, and some related files
