The programs arandr and autorandr are useful for managing the physical displays.
Both are installable via apt.
arandr displays a gui for configuring the monitors
autorandr automates the detection and application of monitor configurations.
    once a configuration is setup, it can be saved with autorandr --save name
    profiles can be loaded by autorandr --load name, or autochanged by autorandr -c
    configs are saved in ~/.config/autorandr/
    post and pre hooks can be added to this directory as well
    for example, the file ~/.config/autorandr/postswitch could have the contents
        #!/bin/sh
        feh --bg-scale /home/archerd/bitma2p.png
    and this script would be run after everytime autorandr changes the displays.
    individual configs can also have hooks, by adding a similar file inside the particular configurations directory.
    the dotfiles repo should install a postswitch hook for autorandr.

    autorandr -c is called by the .xsessionrc in dotfiles

High Resolution displays:
    Stuff is wierd.
    Might be able to get away with just scaling with xrandr, might not.
    If not, refer to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/HiDPI#X_Resources.
    dpi can be estimated from https://dpi.lv, or xdpyinfo might give the value.


Other programs for the displays are
    feh, for setting the background image, and
    xscreensaver, for a screensaver and screening locking.
both are installable via apt.
both are called by the .xsessionrc in dotfiles

installing just xscreensaver gives a working xscreensaver, however, additional screensavers can be downloaded by installing the following repos from apt: xscreensaver-gl xscreensaver-data-extra
xscreensaver can be configured by running xscreensaver-demo
(the xmatrix screensaver, with a low frame rate and mid density is nice)

The redshift program provides a night light mode, see tray.txt.

One other class of programs related to displays are compositors.
Programs like zoom expect a compositor to be running for annotations.
A compositor that I use is compton (installable via apt).
It can be started when needed and then killed afterwards.
