Add the PPA for yubico stuff (following https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016649039-Enabling-the-Yubico-PPA-on-Ubuntu)
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yubico/stable
    sudo apt update

Things to install from the ppa
    yubioath-desktop for otp codes on a yubikey

may add two factor login at some point...

some point is now!
First do some thing to set u2f on linux (https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013708900-Using-Your-U2F-YubiKey-with-Linux)

    ensure libu2f-udev is installed (dpkg -s libu2f-udev) and install if necessary (sudo apt install libu2f-udev)
    add udev rules for yubikeys, currently can be done with wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yubico/libu2f-host/master/70-u2f.rules and moving the file to /etc/udev/rules.d/
    reboot for file to take effect.

Now following https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016649099-Ubuntu-Linux-Login-Guide-U2F
Also install libpam-u2f using apt

Next add yubikeys to account
    mkdir -p ~/.config/Yubico
    insert a key
    pamu2fcfg > ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys
        enter a pin (0xDEF) and then touch the yubikey
    insert a new key
    pamu2fcfg -n >> ~/.config/Yubico/u2f_keys
        enter a pin (0xDEF) and then touch the yubikey

Lastly, require the different verification systems to check the yubikey.
    (add to the pam file things)
    in /etc/pam.d/sudo, /etc/pam.d/gdm-password, and /etc/pam.d/login,
        add 'auth required pam_u2f.so' below the "@include common-auth" line
