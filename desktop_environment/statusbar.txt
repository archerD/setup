The statusbar of choice is xmobar.
xmobar can be installed using cabal.
Cabal can be installed via apt and the cabal-install repository
Once it is installed, run cabal update to get the list of packages,
and then cabal install xmobar --flags="all_extensions"
may have to add --installdir=$HOME/.cabal/bin/ to previous command.
May also need to install a xpm library, such as apt install libxpm-dev
Once installed, add a link to the executable in ~/bin.

Once xmobar is installed, the configuration is in dotfiles, link to $HOME.
The xmonad.hs config file in dotfiles already automatically launches xmobar, so that should be good to go.

Things needed by xmobar:
One thing is that the padding-icon.sh needs to be made available.
This file is in the xmobar repository, at https://github.com/jaor/xmobar, and is also in the dotfiles repo.

Another thing is gsimplecal, availible from repo gsimplecal via apt, and playerctl for the media player, install instructions in ../playerctl.txt.

Last thing is the launcher/menu program gnome-pie, described in launchers.txt.
