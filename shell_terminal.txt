# shell
Currently using bash as my shell of choice, may change in the future.
The default .bashrc has a lot of helpful aliases for coloring things, and ls shortcuts.

.bash_aliases in dotfiles has some other aliases I use, including for some of the programs installed in other sections.
The default .bashrc should load ~/.bash_aliases if exists.

# terminal emulator
Currently migrating to the kitty terminal emulator.
There is a version availible from apt (package is kitty) however it is out of date.
To get latest version, run: curl -L https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/installer.sh | sh /dev/stdin
Then, add a link to ~/.local/kitty.app/bin/kitty somewhere in the path.
For desktop integration (known to menus and what not), do the following:
    # Place the kitty.desktop file somewhere it can be found by the OS
    cp ~/.local/kitty.app/share/applications/kitty.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/
    # Update the path to the kitty icon in the kitty.desktop file
    sed -i "s|Icon=kitty|Icon=/home/$USER/.local/kitty.app/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/kitty.png|g" ~/.local/share/applications/kitty.desktop
(Install instructions from https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/binary.html)

Config is in dotfiles.


Was using the ubuntu default, gnome terminal.
Worked fine for my needs, but I wanted font ligitures, and a portable config file is definitely a plus for kitty as well. 

On colors: Using the White on black scheme, with XTerm palatte.
To change, go to the preferences, then under profiles, select the current profile, then go to the colors tab.
Deselect 'use colors from system theme' and set the the scheme.
Then at the bottom, change the Palette to use the XTerm scheme.
Consider checking 'Show bold text in bright colors'.

Currently migrating to Abduco.
