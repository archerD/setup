Setting up haskell tools.

Cabal:
boot strap process by sudo apt install cabal-install
This will install some stuff.
Then update cabal:
cabal update && cabal install Cabal cabal-install
Symlink the created cabal executable to the path.

Xmonad:
Install as 
cabal install --lib xmonad xmonad-contrib xmonad-extras
cabal install xmonad # installs the xmonad executable
Symlink the created xmonad executable to the path

Xmobar:
cabal install --lib xmobar --flags="all_extensions"
cabal install xmobar --flags="all_extensions" # installs the xmobar executable

HLS:
    To do this we need to install and setup haskell-language-server (https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)
    Since I don't currently use ghcup for haskell stuff, we will install from source.
    Install other dependencies: sudo apt install libicu-dev libncurses-dev libgmp-dev zlib1g-dev
    Then get the source code: git clone https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server --recurse-submodules
    Then in the repo, use ./cabal-hls-install script.
    Pass the help command to see options.  The option to probably use is hls: ./cabal-hls-install hls
    May take some time to get all the packages it needs the first time it is run.
    Once the build finishes, link to the created executables (probably created in ~/.cabal/bin/) from somewhere in the path.

Others:
If it is a library wanted for general usage, such as in ghci, make sure to install with the lib flag:
cabal install --lib $PACKAGE_NAME
