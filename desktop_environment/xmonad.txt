xmonad is a tiling window manager.
it can be installed by xmonad package, and the config packages can be installed via libghc-xmonad-dev, libghc-xmonad-contrib-dev, libghc-xmonad-extra-dev.

the config file is in dotfiles, and belongs in ~/.xmonad/xmonad.hs
after a reboot, the window manager can be selected just before logging in.
the .xsessionrc in dotfiles also auto launches xmonad for the user archerd (along with a bunch of other things... which are discussed in the tray.txt)

Some additional software that should be installed for xmonad to function fully is dmenu and gmrun.
These can be installed via apt from the repos suckless-tools and gmrun.

One last thing to force numlock to start on upon login is numlockx, installable via apt from repo numlockx.
